# Asynchronous_syntheziable_FIFO

This is a Asynchronous syntheziable FIFO design. 
For Asynchronous FIFO design, a FIFO where writes to, and reads from the FIFO buffer are conducted in the different
 clock domain. The FIFO is full when the FIFO counter reaches a
 predetermined full value and the FIFO is empty when the FIFO counter is zero.
To understand this design I recommend you to follow Sunburst Paper.
